This is new file Content Depending on how you obtained the Windows software
, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the device 
manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software 
with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based 
on where you live or, if a business, where your principal place of 
business is l

ocated, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a 

retailer. Microsoft is the device manufacturer for devices produced 
by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer 
if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft. Note that if 
you are a volume license customer, use of this software is subject 
to your volume license agreement rather than this agreement.

This agreement describes your rights and the conditions upon which 

you may use the Windows software. You should review the entire 
agreement, 
including any supplemental license terms that accompany 

the software and any linked terms, because all of the terms are 

important and together create this agreement that applies to you.
